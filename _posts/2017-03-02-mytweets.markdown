## Background

This post employs tidyverse package by <a href='https://hadley.github.io/' >Hadley Wickham </a>

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
Splot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
